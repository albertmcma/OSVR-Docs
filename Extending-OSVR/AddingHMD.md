# Adding a New HMD to OSVR

## Introduction
OSVR creates an abstration layer for many types of devices, including HMDs. This means that the same application can run on different HMDs simply by changing the configuration file that the OSVR server processes when it launches. Adding your HMD to OSVR instantly allows your customers to enjoy the OSVR applications. This note explains the key steps in adding an HMD to OSVR. These are:

- Create a display descriptor. This specifies the key attributes of the HMD such as the field of view
- Provide information about distortion. OSVR can apply distortion correction for the HMD. This step is optional.
- Support direct rendering. When used with a supported graphics card, OSVR provides direct rendering support to HMDs and this section discusses how to add this capability to your HMD through OSVR
- Often, HMDs also include peripherals such as an orientation tracker. The section on the tracker points you at the right documents towards adding the HMD tracker.

## Creating a Basic display descriptor
To start with OSVR, all you need to get a display going initially is just a "display descriptor" JSON file. You can start with a very simple one - the one for the OSVR HDK 1.0-1.2 is about as simple as they get - and modify it to suit your display.

- Format Documentation: <https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-JSON-Schemas/blob/master/doc/display_descriptor_schema_v1/Structure%20of%20JSON%20descriptor%20file%20for%20HMDs.md>
- JSON Schema: <https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-JSON-Schemas/blob/master/display_descriptor_schema_v1.json>
- Existing descriptors for additional reference: <https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Core/tree/master/apps/displays> - see particularly [the descriptor for the HDK 1.0-1.2](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Core/blob/master/apps/displays/OSVR_HDK_1_1.json)

The only fields you must modify are:

- The metadata fields - primarily for human consumption, though Render Manager also uses `vendor`:
	- `hmd.device.vendor`
	- `hmd.device.model`
	- `hmd.device.Version`
	- `hmd.device.Note`
- The basic optics:
	- `hmd.field_of_view.monocular_horizontal`
	- `hmd.field_of_view.monocular_vertical`
	- `hmd.field_of_view.overlap` if the screens are not aligned (gross generalization)
- The basic display control/input data:
	- In the resolution entry, the `width` and `height`, and, if yours isn't a single input horizontal side-by-side, `display_mode` and potentially `video_inputs`.

To use a display descriptor with an OSVR server config file, you add or edit the `"display": "???.json"` line. See, for example, [a server config that specifies the display descriptor for the Sensics dSight HMD](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Core/blob/master/apps/sample-configs/osvr_server_config.dSight.json). (If no display line is specified, then a default is used.) A useful minimal sample to test your display descriptor (does not test distortion) would be the OpenGLSample in the OSVR-Core distribution (requires SDL), which places you in a cube.

## Adding Distortion Correction
In many cases, displays have some degree of distortion that should be compensated for ahead of time through predistortion. OSVR has a number of parameterizations of distortion, suited to different types of distortion, and different tools for measuring them.  All of these modes can be specified in the server configuration files and read using the OSVR-Core libraries and several of them are implemented in the OSVR-RenderManager interface.

A theoretical description of distortion correction and its relationship to projection and viewing can be found in the [distortion document](../Configuring/distortion.md) and a program to construct the distortion parameters based on a mapping from angles to screen coordinates can be found in the [AnglesToConfig documentation](https://github.com/OSVR/distortionizer/blob/master/angles_to_config/doc/anglesToConfig.md).

The Core modes (implemented on a non-RenderManager path of OSVR-Unity) as of 1/25/2016 include:

- K1-parameter-based distortion - Based on quadratic distortion from a center for red, green, and blue.

The RenderManager modes as of 1/25/2016 include:

- Chromatic General-polynomial-based distortion - Based on radial distortion around a defined center of projection for reg, green, and blue.  See the description in Rendermanager.h for details on how this is specified.
- Monochromatic point samples - Based on an arbitrary mapping from angles to screen-space locations, often from a lens simulation performed on the optics.  See the [distortion document](../Configuring/distortion.md) for a description.
- Chromatic point samples - Based on an arbitrary mapping from angles to screen-space locations for red, green, and blue, often from a lens simulation performed on the optics.  See the [distortion document](../Configuring/distortion.md) for a description.

The process of constructing a configuration file that uses point-sampled distortion correction is described near the end of the [AnglesToConfig documentation](https://github.com/OSVR/distortionizer/blob/master/angles_to_config/doc/anglesToConfig.md).  The basic approach is to construct an appropriate server-side configuration file (with a matching client-side file if needed) and then run the standard OSVR server with that configuration file.  Any RenderManager-based client will then perform the specified distortion correction during rendering.

A snippet from a configuration file that specifies general-polynomial-based distortion follows:

    {
      "display": {
        "hmd": {
          "distortion": {
            "type": "rgb_symmetric_polynomials",
            "distance_scale_x": 1,
            "distance_scale_y": 1,
            "polynomial_coeffs_red": [ 0, 1, 0.25 ],
            "polynomial_coeffs_green": [ 0, 1, 0.32 ],
            "polynomial_coeffs_blue": [ 0, 1, 0.40 ]
          }
        }
      }
    }

## Supporting Direct Rendering
The final step is direct-to-HMD rendering: bypassing operating system and window management overhead, removing the display from being a part of the extended desktop, and drawing directly to it using the graphics driver. OSVR's RenderManager handles both non-direct advanced rendering (timewarp, advanced predistortion, etc.) available with just a regular display descriptor as above, as well as optional direct mode support, which is generally only available on some combinations of hardware vendors and software platforms.

Using direct rendering requires specification of the vendor ID in three-letter format and construction of a RenderManager configuration file with that vendor ID and with screen resolution and rotatation that matches one of the modes supported by the HMD (ideally, the most-rapid rendering mode).  As of 1/25/2016, the OSVR team is finalizing the format for specifying arbitrary vendor IDs; the system currently does an internal mapping from vendor names to IDs.  To add such a mapping, you should edit the createRenderManager() function in RenderManagerBase.cpp to add another vendor-name mapping.  The vendor name should map to all display vendor IDs that you produce (see the OSVR HDK for an example of how to add more than one vendor ID).

Because of non-disclosure agreements with nVidia and AMD, the source code for the vendor-specific portions of the DirectRender code cannot be released.  They have agreed to let OSVR provide a common interface to their direct-render capabilities through the RenderManager interface, using NDA submodules.  This means that we currently need to recmopile RenderManager with the new vendor IDs and release a new version.  Please issue a pull request once your vnedor IDs have been added so that they will appear in future releases.

Note that non-DirectMode display (including time warping, predictive tracking, and distortion correction) is available in RenderManager using the open-source portion of the library.  (As of 1/25/2016, the open-source version is being pulled out into its own repository.)

## Tracking and Status Reporting
Your HMD presumably has tracking either integrated or attached. If it's an off-the-shelf tracker, then there's probably already support in OSVR for it via VRPN: see more on the [Compatibility page](http://osvr.github.io/compatibility/). A tracker for an HMD should provide the /me/head alias at the center point between the two eyes centers.

If you have a custom tracking system, and/or if your device has an interface for control and status messages, you might be interested in writing a device plugin to provide more interaction with the OSVR system than just as a display device. Get in touch, and/or see the [Building a Plugin](http://osvr.github.io/build-with/#building-a-plugin) documentation.

Tracking can be tested with the OSVR Tracker Viewer (can be downloaded from http://osvr.github.io/using/ - by default it will attempt to show the /me/head alias.
